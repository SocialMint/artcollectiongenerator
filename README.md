## Usage Quick Start

1. Run the Nft Art Generator executable
2. Click the "Load Input Folder" Button
3. Select the folder which contains your NFT image layer folders (Output images are saved in a folder at the same level e.g. if input folder is in Desktop, the output folder will also be placed there)
4. Adjust the layer ordering by dragging the layers to position
5. Adjust the individual layer percentage probabilities
6. Adjust the rarity folder percentage probabilities - **must add up to 100**
7. Test that image creation is as expected by clicking the "Random" button
8. Set the number of Nfts to generate
9. Select the blockchain to generate metadata for
10. **Optional** - Set "Art Base Name" NFT Image prefix (This only sets the image metadata name)

## Concepts
### Layer
Image artwork is composed of many layers stacked on each other. Layers can have a percentage probability assigned.

### Rarity Folder
Layers contain a common, fixed number of rarity folders. Each rarity folder defines a configurable "probability bucket" in which layer items can be placed.

### Item
An item is an individual piece of artwork which belongs to a layer, items layered on top of other items make up the image.

### Image creation process
Each image goes through the following process in order to be created:

For each layer, a random roll is made to determine selection.

For each _selected_ layer, another random roll is made to select which rarity folder is selected.

Each rarity folder has a random image selected from it, if no images exist, nothing is selected for the layer.

If the end image has already been generated, repeat the whole process until a unique image is generated.
Metadata is created for this created image.


## Requirements
The application assumes these to be true in order for it to function correctly.

### Folder Structure
The input folder should be structured as follows:

Input Folder > Layers > Rarity Folders > Items

Rarity Folders need to be the same across all the layers

#### Example Folder Structure

```
ðŸ“¦Input Folder
â”£ ðŸ“‚Accessory
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Background
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Eyes
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Face
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Hands
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Mouth
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare

###  Layer Names
Individual words in a layers name must be separated by an underscore in order for the matching metadata to be generated correctly.
###  Item Names
Individual words in an items name must be separated by an underscore in order for the matching metadata to be generated correctly.
###  Image Dimensions
Images need to have the same width and height, so that the position of the image item is correct relative to the other layered image items.
