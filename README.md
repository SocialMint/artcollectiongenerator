## Concepts
### Layer
Image artwork is composed of many layers stacked on each other. Layers can have a percentage probability assigned.

### Rarity Folder
Layers contain a common, fixed number of rarity folders. Each rarity folder defines a configurable "probability bucket" in which layer items can be placed.

### Item
An item is an individual piece of artwork which belongs to a layer, items layered on top of other items make up the image.

### Image creation process
Each image goes through the following process in order to be created:

For each layer, a random roll is made to determine selection.

For each _selected_ layer, another random roll is made to select which rarity folder is selected.

Each rarity folder has a random image selected from it, if no images exist, nothing is selected for the layer.

If the end image has already been generated, repeat the whole process until a unique image is generated.
Metadata is created for this created image.


## Requirements
The application assumes these to be true in order for it to function correctly.

### Folder Structure
The input folder should be structured as follows:

Input Folder > Layers > Rarity Folders > Items

Rarity Folders need to be the same across all the layers

#### Example Folder Structure

```
ðŸ“¦Input Folder
â”£ ðŸ“‚Accessory
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Background
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Eyes
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Face
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Hands
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare
ðŸ“‚Mouth
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚common
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚legendary
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rare
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚super_rare

###  Layer Names
Individual words in a layers name must be separated by an underscore in order for the matching metadata to be generated correctly.
###  Item Names
Individual words in an items name must be separated by an underscore in order for the matching metadata to be generated correctly.
###  Image Dimensions
Images need to have the same width and height, so that the position of the image item is correct relative to the other layered image items.
